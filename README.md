Flask Madlibs

In this exercise, you’ll use Flask to make a Madlibs game.

About Madlibs
In Madlibs, you’re asked a series of questions, like this:

plural_noun: turnips
verb: juggle
Those are then plugged into a story template, like this:

I love to {verb} {plural_noun}.
To create a story like:

I love to juggle turnips.
Code
We’ve given you some code to help with the core non-Flask-specific Madlibs part:

stories.py
"""Madlibs Stories."""


class Story:
    """Madlibs story.

    To  make a story, pass a list of prompts, and the text
    of the template.

        >>> s = Story(["noun", "verb"],
        ...     "I love to {verb} a good {noun}.")

    To generate text from a story, pass in a dictionary-like thing
    of {prompt: answer, promp:answer):

        >>> ans = {"verb": "eat", "noun": "mango"}
        >>> s.generate(ans)
        'I love to eat a good mango.'
    """

    def __init__(self, words, text):
        """Create story with words and template text."""

        self.prompts = words
        self.template = text

    def generate(self, answers):
        """Substitute answers into text."""

        text = self.template

        for (key, val) in answers.items():
            text = text.replace("{" + key + "}", val)

        return text


# Here's a story to get you started


story = Story(
    ["place", "noun", "verb", "adjective", "plural_noun"],
    """Once upon a time in a long-ago {place}, there lived a
       large {adjective} {noun}. It loved to {verb} {plural_noun}."""
)
This allows you to define Madlibs stories, and it can generate the resulting story from a set of answers. (It’s also a nice example of a small but useful class!)

We’ve created a story, story, in that file.

Before starting to make a Flask app, make sure you understand how this Story class works — go into ipython and try out the generate method on our sample story to get a feel for the text-generating process for Madlibs.

Challenge
Write a Flask app that imports the example story. Add a homepage for the application that shows a form prompting you for all the words in the story:

Don’t hardcode this, though — you want your form route to be able to ask for all of the questions required by the story, not for it to have a hard-coded form of asking these exact questions!

Add a route, /story, that shows the resulting story for those answers, like this:

For now, don’t worry about having template inheritance or a base.html — later, in further study, you can refactor this to use template inheritance.
